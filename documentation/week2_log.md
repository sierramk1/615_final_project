This week the project goals focused around algorithm implementations, specifically to implement the one-dimensional algorithms: Bisection, Secant, Newton-Raphson, Golden Search in Python, to test them in Jupyter notebooks and compare to existing Python packages (like SciPy), and to use GenAI to implement basic visualization plots with Plotly for each algorithmâ€™s output.

I began with implementing the one-dimensional algorithms.
