This week the project goals focused around algorithm implementations, specifically to implement the one-dimensional algorithms: Bisection, Secant, Newton-Raphson, Golden Search in Python, to test them in Jupyter notebooks and compare to existing Python packages (like SciPy), and to use GenAI to implement basic visualization plots with Plotly for each algorithmâ€™s output.

I began with implementing the one-dimensional algorithms, and then prompted Gemini to create a Jupyter Notebook to test the algorithms with SciPy and NumPy. I did run into some problems with Gemini creating the testing notebook as it failed to properly format the file as a JSON. I fed it the error message that Jupyter told me and continued to fail to produce a working notebook 3 more times. At one point, it decided to write a python script to create the Jupyter notebook and this still failed. Finally, it decided to create the python script line by line, which was incredibly slow and BLANK. This whole error process took about 20 minutes, before Gemini completely broke and glitched out. I decided to create the notebook myself and see if Gemini could still write the code to check the algorithms. Which it did, but it wanted me to add the code manually to the Jupyter notebook in fear of messing it up again. Images of the error process and work through can be found in screenshots/week2. 

The notebook can be found in the testing_notebooks folder, and the results showed that my implementations were correct against SciPy and NumPy using well-known example functions and results taken from the literature in the project proposal. However, I spent quite some time debugging the test and ran across an interesting fact about SciPy's Golden Search which is that it does not strictly enforce the bracket boundaries. I also decided to format my screenshots by weeks for organization.
