This week the project goals focused around algorithm implementations, specifically: Implement 1D algos: Bisection, Secant, Newton-Raphson, Golden Search in Python, Test them in Jupyter notebooks and compare to existing Python packages (like SciPy), Use GenAI to implement basic visualization plots with Plotly for each algorithmâ€™s output , Log code, tests, and visualizations, as well as relevant GenAI use in Github
