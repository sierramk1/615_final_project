# Pseudocode for the Newton-Raphson Method

This algorithm finds successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. It starts with an initial guess and uses the function's value and its derivative to find the next approximation.

**FUNCTION** NewtonRaphson(f, fp, x0, tol, max_iter)

  // **INPUTS:**
  // f: The function for which we are finding a root.
  // fp: The first derivative of the function f.
  // x0: The initial guess for the root.
  // tol: The desired tolerance for convergence.
  // max_iter: The maximum number of iterations.

  // **INITIALIZATION:**
  current_x = x0

  // Check if initial guess is already the root
  IF abs(f(current_x)) < tol THEN
    RETURN current_x
  END IF

  // **ITERATION:**
  FOR iter FROM 1 TO max_iter DO
    f_x = f(current_x)
    fp_x = fp(current_x)

    // Check for derivative near zero (potential division by zero or flat region)
    IF abs(fp_x) < tol THEN
      OUTPUT "Error: Derivative is too close to zero."
      RETURN null
    END IF

    // Calculate the next approximation using the Newton-Raphson formula
    next_x = current_x - (f_x / fp_x)

    // Yield current state for visualization (current_x, next_x)

    // Check for convergence
    IF abs(next_x - current_x) < tol THEN
      RETURN next_x
    END IF

    // Update for next iteration
    current_x = next_x

  END FOR

  // If max_iter reached without convergence
  OUTPUT "Newton-Raphson method did not converge after " + max_iter + " iterations."
  RETURN null

**END FUNCTION**
