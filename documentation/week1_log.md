This week, the project goals were:
-- Design system architecture: define the structure for algorithm implementations, visualization frontend, and necessary backend components
-- Structure Github repository with named folders for algorithms, notebooks, visualizations, and documentation and README with project goals and instructions to follow along
-- Install and learn Gemini CLI: explore its capabilities for visualization, UI generation, etc	

The following was accomplished:
The system architecture is outlined in the README file, and the corresponding folders were added to the repository. Work on installing and setting up Gemini CLI is still in progress...
