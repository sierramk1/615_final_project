I had some change of plans this week as I had to reorganize my plan for hosting and developing the application. I decided to host it on render using a flask with javascript backend and react frontend. This meant I added a backend folder and converted my algorithm files from python to javascript with Gemini. I also had Gemini create a Node.js file to test the algorithmic implementations for the multi-dimensional algorithms against SciPy, which can be found in the screenshots folder under week 3. 

After these algorithm steps, I moved onto setting up React and Flask. Gemini was very helpful at explaining how to install and get everything set up, but I found that running installation commands was more simple in a separate terminal where I could see what was going on, as Gemini doesn’t send feedback until its done running so I wasn’t sure what was happening. Gemini made a little typo at some point deleting files but it caught it by itself. With the help of Gemini, I was able to get the application working with a basic Plotly graph and the 6 algorithms with a single function root test for each.

Some other things I learned this week is that Gemini has no memory of past conversations, as each session is independent and knowledge based on the current conversation only. However, there is a save-memory tool that allow Gemini to remember specific facts, I used it to have Gemini no longer add prefixes to commit messages.

Additionally, Gemini is pretty nice in that it can surf the web if you have current relevant questions. I asked it for the news from the previous day and it easily pulled up information. Found in screenshot Gemini_week3_websurfing. However, if you leave a session for a long time like I did, it can only surf the web from the day before the session started so the longer the session is open the more out of date its information can be.

Later in the week, I spent some more time with Gemini developing the interactivity of the application. I did run into a problem when I asked Gemini to update a file with code it suggested, it seems the code to update the file was too large fro Gemini to process in a single command so it defaulted to creating a python script to write to the original file. This method proved to be more stable for creating the JavaScript files, but it is another few steps that Gemini has to take, and they must be approved of. I think this supports my general feelings that Gemini is very helpful but more so for small changes, bugs, maybe Git commands, and not so much writing lots of code. Once I got bisection working as I wanted, I implemented Golden Search which was much easier now that Gemini knew what worked and didn’t. I will also credit Gemini for remembering how I wanted to visualize the golden ratio in the graph from the Jupyter notebook we worked on, but this was because I never terminated the session. However, I ran into the same problem a lot this week where Gemini wanted to update an algorithmic visualization we already had worked on, despite numerous explanations that it was already done.
